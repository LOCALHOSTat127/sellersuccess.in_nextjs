However, the concept of HUF is specific to Indian law and may not have equivalents in other legal systems.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">The family continues to exist even after the death of the common ancestor and the next eldest male member becomes the head of the family or the “Karta”. In financial terms, we can call him ‘manager of the family’.
