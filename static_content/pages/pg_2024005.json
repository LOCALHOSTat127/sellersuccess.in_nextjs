                          "answer": "An OPC, or One Person Company, is a type of business entity that allows a single individual to form and operate a company with limited liability. It provides a separate legal identity to the business, enabling the owner to enjoy the benefits of limited liability while retaining full control over the company’s operations."

                          "answer": "While both OPCs and sole proprietorships are businesses operated by a single individual, the key difference lies in their legal structure and liability. OPCs provide limited liability protection to the owner, whereas sole proprietorships do not offer this protection, and the owner is personally liable for the company’s debts and obligations."

                          "answer": "Every OPC is required to nominate a nominee director in its memorandum and articles of association. The nominee director is appointed to take over the management of the company in the event of the owner’s death or incapacity. The nominee director must be an Indian citizen and resident in India."

                          "answer": "Yes, an OPC can be converted into a private limited company once it meets certain criteria, such as having a paid-up share capital exceeding the prescribed threshold or achieving a certain level of turnover. The conversion process involves filing an application with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) and complying with the relevant regulations."

                          "answer": "No, an OPC can have only one director, who is also the sole shareholder of the company. However, the owner can appoint additional directors to the board if the company’s articles of association permit it or if required by law."

They are subject to income tax on their profits, and dividend distributions to the owner are taxed as per the individual’s tax slab. OPCs may be eligible for certain tax benefits available to small businesses or startups."
