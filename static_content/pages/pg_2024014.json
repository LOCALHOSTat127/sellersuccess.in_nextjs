     "content": "<section class=\"dynamic_html_fluyed\"><p class=\"paragraph\">GST was introduced in India on July 1, 2017, with the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. It aims to simplify the indirect tax structure, streamline compliance, and create a unified national market.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">GST Registration is applicable on all goods and services except Petroleum products as of now. Goods & Service Tax (GST) is a consolidated tax, which essentially means that State and Central Indirect taxes have been merged. Entire country now operates under a uniform tax system. It now replaces service tax, excise, VAT, entertainment tax, luxury tax, octroi, CST etc.</p><div class=\"para_with_head\"><p class=\"head\">Who can become a Member in Producer Company?</p><p>A person being a “producer” or a “producer institution” (whether incorporated or not) can be admitted as member of Producer Company</p></div><div class=\"list_container\"><p class=\"section-title\">Tax Structure - GST is levied at multiple rates, including :</p><ul><li>CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax): Levied by the Central Government on intra-state supplies of goods and services.</li><li>SGST (State Goods and Services Tax): Levied by the State Governments on intra-state supplies of goods and services.</li><li>IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax): Levied by the Central Government on inter-state supplies of goods and services and imports into India.</li><li>UTGST (Union Territory Goods and Services Tax): Levied by Union Territory Governments on intra-UT supplies of goods and services.</li><li>ST is levied at different rates, including 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with certain goods and services attracting a nil rate or being exempt from GST. Additionally, there are separate rates for specific items such as gold, petroleum, and alcohol.</li></ul></div><p class=\"paragraph\">The GST exemption limit earlier was Rs 20 lakhs for all the businesses and services. But now with latest amendment Businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh are exempted from GST. Additionally, those with a turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore can opt for the Composition Scheme and pay only 1% tax. However, for services the exemption limit of turnover is still 20 lakhs. Also, service provider having turnover up to 50 lakhs can opt for composition scheme for services and pay only 6% of tax</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Hence, it would be compulsory to get GST registered only for traders, manufacturers, businesses, individuals, professionals etc, whose turnover (sales) exceed INR 40 Lakh. If your sales are less than INR 40 Lakh, you may also voluntarily opt for GST Registration in case you wish to avail the benefits of Input Tax Credit. Further, all persons who make interstate purchase or sales of services or goods have to apply for GST registration. Above limits do not apply to them.</p><div class=\"list_container\"><p class=\"section-title\">Key Points to Remember :</p><ul><li><span>Tax Rates</span> GST is levied at different rates, including 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with certain goods and services attracting a nil rate or being exempt from GST. Additionally, there are separate rates for specific items such as gold, petroleum, and alcohol.</li><li><span>Registration</span> Businesses engaged in the supply of goods or services with an annual turnover exceeding the prescribed threshold are required to register for GST. Registration is mandatory for inter-state suppliers, regardless of turnover.</li><li><span>Input Tax Credit (ITC)</span> One of the key features of GST is the mechanism of input tax credit, which allows businesses to claim credit for the GST paid on inputs (purchases) against the GST liability on outputs (sales). This helps eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and reduces the overall tax burden on businesses.</li><li><span>Composition Scheme</span> Small businesses with a turnover below a certain threshold (currently Rs. 1.5 crore) can opt for the composition scheme, under which they are taxed at a lower rate and are subject to simplified compliance requirements.</li><li><span>GSTN</span> The Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is the IT backbone of the GST regime, responsible for handling the registration, return filing, and other compliance processes. It provides a common portal for taxpayers to register, file returns, make payments, and claim refunds under GST.</li><li><span>Compliance</span> GST compliance involves filing periodic returns, such as GSTR-1 (outward supplies), GSTR-3B (summary return), and GSTR-9 (annual return), as well as paying the applicable tax liabilities on time. Non-compliance can attract penalties and interest.</li><li><span>E-Way Bill</span> Under GST, the movement of goods beyond a certain distance or value threshold requires the generation of an electronic waybill (e-way bill) on the GSTN portal. This helps ensure proper documentation and tracking of goods in transit.</li><li><span>Anti-Profiteering Measures</span> GST includes provisions to prevent profiteering by businesses as a result of GST rate reductions. The National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA) oversees complaints related to profiteering and ensures that the benefits of GST rate reductions are passed on to consumers.</li></ul></div><div class=\"para_with_head\"><p class=\"head\">Aadhaar Card is mandatory to get GST registration</p><p>A new system for new GST registration has been introduced and activated from 21st August, 2020 where the Aadhaar card is now mandatory for GST registration. That means, the applicant who are seeking for GST registration now will be given an option to select if he wishes to authenticate Aadhaar or wishes to opt for physical verification. If the applicant opts for Aadhaar authentication for his GST registration then the applicant will get his / her GST registration in just three days.</p></div></section>",
