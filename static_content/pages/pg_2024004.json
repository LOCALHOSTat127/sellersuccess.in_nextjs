This means it can enter into contracts, own property, sue, and be sued in its own name.</li> <li><span>Limited Liability :</span> Shareholders of a Private Limited Company have limited liability, meaning their personal assets are protected from the company’s debts and liabilities. They are only liable for the amount unpaid on their shares.</li> <li><span>Ownership :</span> Ownership of a Private Limited Company is represented by shares. These shares can be owned by individuals, other companies, or even trusts. The shareholders’ rights and responsibilities are outlined in the company’s Articles of Association.</li> <li><span>Number of Shareholders :</span> Private Limited Companies typically have a limited number of shareholders, often ranging from a minimum of one to a maximum specified by law. This contrasts with public companies, which can have an unlimited number of shareholders.</li> <li><span>Restrictions on Share Transfer :</span> Private Limited Companies often impose restrictions on the transfer of shares, such as requiring shareholder approval or offering the shares first to existing shareholders before selling them to third parties. This helps maintain control over ownership and management.</li> <li><span>Management Structure :</span> Private Limited Companies are managed by directors appointed by the shareholders. The directors are responsible for running the company’s day-to-day operations and making strategic decisions on behalf of the shareholders.</li> <li><span>Financial Reporting :</span> Private Limited Companies are required to prepare and file annual financial statements with the relevant regulatory authorities. These statements provide an overview of the company’s financial performance and position.</li> <li><span>Privacy :</span> Private Limited Companies generally offer greater privacy compared to public companies. They are not required to disclose as much information to the public, such as financial statements or details of shareholders and directors.</li> <li><span>Capital Raising :</span> While Private Limited Companies can raise capital by issuing shares, they cannot offer shares to the public through a stock exchange. Instead, they typically raise funds from private investors, banks, or other financial institutions.</li> <li><span>Continuity :</span> A Private Limited Company enjoys perpetual succession, meaning its existence is not affected by changes in ownership or the death of shareholders or directors. This provides continuity and stability to the business.</li> </ul> </div> </section>",
