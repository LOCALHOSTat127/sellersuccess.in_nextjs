One can start a wholly owned Indian subsidiary anywhere in India. There are no state-specific laws. There’s only one central law that governs Indian Subsidiary Set up across India. All you need a resident Indian director (not necessarily a shareholder but can be an employee!) and a rented (virtual) place of office to get going. 100% ownership, strategic decision making and control of operations rest with your parent company at all times.</p><div class=\"list_container\"><p class=\"section-title\">Registering a company in India as a foreigner involves several steps and considerations. Here’s a general overview of the process:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>Choose the Type of Entity: Determine the type of entity you want to register.
