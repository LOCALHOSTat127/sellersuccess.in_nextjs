     "content": "<section class=\"dynamic_html_fluyed\"><p class=\"paragraph\">LLP Registration, a prime reason why it has evolved is that of its simplicity in formation and easy maintenance. It helps owners also to limit their liabilities. This is the biggest advantage of the Limited Liability Partnership over a traditional Partnership Firm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">No partner is liable on account of unauthorized actions of other partners, thus individual partners are shielded from joint liability created by another partner’s misconduct. LLP form of organization is usually preferred by Professionals, Micro and Small businesses that are family owned or closely-held</p><p class=\"paragraph\">With the introduction of Limited Liability Partnership (Second Amendment) Rules, 2022, MCA has now made LLP registration procedure even more easier and transparent as now all the LLP forms will be web based forms. An LLP can now be incorporated with up to 5 instead of 2 Designated Partners (without DPIN). Also, with the LLP (2nd Amendment) Rules, 2022, LLPs shall be allotted their PAN and TAN along with the Certificate of Incorporation itself. Hence, no need of separate application for PAN and TAN. Procedure of LLP registration is not lengthy as you can file your incorporation form online. Online LLP registration procedure will save you a lot of time and energy. </p><p class=\"paragraph\">Every LLP is required to have at least two Designated Partners who shall be individuals and at least one of them shall be a Resident of India. The mutual rights and duties of partners shall be governed by the agreement between LLP and the partners. This Agreement would be known as “LLP Agreement”.</p><div class=\"list_container\"><p class=\"section-title\">Key Points to Remember :</p><ul class=\"list\"><li><span>Formation and Registration :</span> To form an LLP in India, a minimum of two partners is required. There is no upper limit on the number of partners. At least two designated partners must be individuals, and at least one of them must be a resident of India. The LLP must be registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) through an online process.</li><li><span>Limited Liability :</span> One of the primary advantages of an LLP is that partners have limited liability, meaning their personal assets are protected from the debts and liabilities of the LLP. Each partner’s liability is limited to the extent of their agreed contribution to the LLP.</li><li><span>Separate Legal Entity :</span> An LLP is a separate legal entity distinct from its partners. It can own assets, enter into contracts, sue or be sued in its own name. The LLP continues to exist irrespective of changes in its partners.</li><li><span>Taxation :</span> LLPs are taxed as a partnership, with profits and losses flowing through to the partners and taxed at their individual income tax rates. LLPs are not subject to dividend distribution tax (DDT). </li><li><span>Compliance Requirements :</span> LLPs have fewer compliance requirements compared to companies. They are required to file an annual return and statement of accounts with the Registrar of Companies (ROC). Audit requirements depend on the LLP’s turnover and capital contribution.</li><li><span>Flexibility :</span> LLPs offer flexibility in management and operation. Partners can decide on the internal structure, decision-making processes, profit-sharing ratios, and other matters through the LLP Agreement.</li><li><span>Professional Services :</span> LLPs are commonly used by professionals such as lawyers, accountants, consultants, and architects to conduct their business. They provide the benefits of limited liability while allowing professionals to pool resources and expertise.</li><li><span>Conversion and Dissolution :</span> LLPs can be converted into a company or vice versa, subject to compliance with the applicable procedures. LLPs can also be dissolved voluntarily or by order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).</li><li><span>Audit and Accounting :</span> LLPs are required to maintain proper books of accounts and undergo an annual audit if their turnover exceeds prescribed limits. However, small LLPs may be exempt from audit requirements.</li></ul></div></section>",
