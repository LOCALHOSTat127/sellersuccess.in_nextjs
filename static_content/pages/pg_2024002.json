If you are planning to raise funds from the public through Initial Public Offer (IPO) then Start your business by incorporating Public Limited Company.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">A public limited company is usually established to generate capital from external sources, i.e. the general public for starting a business, business expansion, technological advancement, global expansion, etc.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">But a PLC is suitable to the large organizations which have a comprehensive perspective and higher growth possibilities, rather than a small shop located next door.</p><div class=\"list_container\"><p class=\"section-title\">Key Points to Remember :</p><ul class=\"list\"><li><span>Formation and Registration :</span> Formation of a public limited company involves registration with the appropriate regulatory authority, which varies depending on the country’s laws and regulations. It typically requires a memorandum of association and articles of association outlining the company’s objectives, internal rules, and regulations. Minimum capital requirements may apply, and the company must comply with various legal and regulatory requirements.</li><li><span>Ownership Structure :</span> Ownership of a public limited company is divided into shares, which are held by shareholders. Shareholders invest capital in the company by purchasing shares. Shareholders elect the board of directors, who oversee the company’s management and strategic decision-making.</li><li><span>Limited Liability :</span> Shareholders in a public limited company enjoy limited liability, meaning their personal assets are generally protected from the company’s debts and liabilities. Their liability is typically limited to the amount unpaid on their shares. Creditors of the company cannot typically pursue the personal assets of shareholders to settle corporate debts.</li><li><span>Share Capital :</span> A public limited company issues shares to the public through an initial public offering (IPO) on a stock exchange. This process involves selling shares to investors in exchange for capital. The company can issue different classes of shares, such as ordinary shares, preference shares, or redeemable shares, each with its own rights and privileges.</li><li><span>Corporate Governance :</span> Public limited companies are governed by a board of directors elected by shareholders. The board is responsible for overseeing the company’s operations, appointing senior management, and making strategic decisions. Corporate governance standards require transparency, accountability, and fairness in decision-making to protect the interests of shareholders and stakeholders.</li><li><span>Regulation and Compliance :</span> Public limited companies are subject to extensive regulation and compliance requirements, including financial reporting, disclosure of information to shareholders and regulatory authorities, and adherence to corporate governance standards. Regulatory bodies, such as securities commissions or market regulators, oversee the activities of public limited companies to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.</li><li><span>Public Disclosure :</span> Public limited companies are required to disclose financial and non-financial information to the public, including annual financial statements, quarterly reports, and information about significant corporate events. This transparency helps investors make informed decisions and promotes market integrity and confidence.</li><li><span>Access to Capital :</span> Being publicly traded allows public limited companies to access a wide pool of capital from investors in the stock market. This capital can be used for business expansion, investment in new projects, research and development, and other purposes.</li><li><span>Market Listing :</span> Public limited companies list their shares on a stock exchange, where they are traded among investors. Common stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange (LSE), and others. Listing on a stock exchange provides liquidity to shareholders by allowing them to buy and sell shares easily.</li><li><span>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) :</span> Public limited companies often have CSR initiatives to contribute positively to society and the environment. CSR activities may include philanthropy, environmental sustainability efforts, employee welfare programs, and ethical business practices.</li></ul></div></section>",
